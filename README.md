# pacman_project
In this project I used simple Python functions that generate logical sentences describing Pacman physics, aka pacphysics, and a SAT solver, pycosat, to solve the logical inference tasks associated with planning (generating action sequences to reach goal locations and eat all the dots), localization (finding oneself in a map, given a local sensor model), mapping (building the map from scratch), and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
