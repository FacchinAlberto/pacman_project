In this project there have been used simple Python functions that generate logical sentences describing Pacman physics, aka pacphysics.
Then it has been used a SAT solver, pycosat, to solve the logical inference tasks associated with planning (generating action sequences to reach goal locations and eat all the dots), 
localization (finding oneself in a map, given a local sensor model), mapping (building the map from scratch), and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping).
